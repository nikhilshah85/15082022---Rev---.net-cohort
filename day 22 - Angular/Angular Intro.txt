				Web Revolution (2008 - 2016)
		World Average first internet user = 2006
		What did you use internet for = Chatting, Games, Emails and surfing
		Where did you use internet = Home,school or University, Cybercafe
		How did you use internet - Devise - Desktop / Laptop
		Source of Internet - Telephone - Modem - Wifi

		Thus developers user to develop Web Contents accordingly
			and technologies were available accordingly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		What do you use internet for - Everything
		Where do you use internet - Everywhere 
		Devise - Phones, Tables, watches, cctv, etc...
			Resolution - 200+ resolutions, 
			Hardware 
			Habbits  - based on contents 			
					for image - zoom in zoom out 
					for videos - flip the resolution 
					use navigator - check in at places, lat lon
		Source of internet - 2G and 3G, 4G and 5G 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	Developer has to develop the contents 

	So far we have be developing (including ASP.net MVC apps)
		Server centeric applications - contents

		but now we have client in center and need to create 
		Client / devise centeric applications

		client devises understands only 3 things
			HTML, CSS and JS

		Thus we need a framework for the same and fix the buggs, errors, challanges with this 3 languages

		HTML to HTML5
		CSS to CSS3
		JS - was not object oriented 
			Thus W3C and ECMA (European Computer Manufacturing Association)
			Introduced ES - EcmaScript which is OOPS version of Javascript
			Very difficult for developers to learn, write and understand

			Thus Microsoft came forward - understood ES
				and made it more simple - similar to Java / C#
				and gave a compiler for the same
		Named that language as Typescript (TS)

	----------
	Google liked TS, used ts and gave us the framework for client centeric application development - Angular

	Facebook liked TS, used ts and gave us the framework for client UI development
			- React
	Twitter also gave us Bootstrap based on the same 

------------------------------------------------------------------
		Angular -----> Developer ---> TS Code ---> Compiler(Node) ---> JS

--------------------------------------------------------
	Angular Ecosystem for Development - 
			Component
			Pipes
			Services
			Routing

------------------------------------------------------------------
