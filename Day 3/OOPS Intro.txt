			OOPS - Object Oriented Programming System 

				a. A developer should look at everything as an Object

				b. An Object is an Real World Entity
					Made up of
						Properties - Describe an object
							getter and setter
						Methods / Functions
							actions
						Events
							Retrospective action
						Constructor
							How is an object created
						ENUMS
							Fixed set of pre-defined values

				c. We Design the object in a class file (.cs file)
					create multiple objects from the design 
						Class - is a Blue print of an object
				d. There are 4 pillars to Design an Object
					i. Abstraction
				       ii. Encapsulation
				      iii. Inheritance
				       iv. Polymorphism

	
		 Abstraction	- What properties and methods, events, enums, constructors etc
				should be a part of an object			
					out of MY 100's of properties
					Open a bank accounts
			Consider only those properties, methods, events, enums, constructors etc as per the context of your 			application

		Encapsulation  - Create things which are easy to use, but very very difficult to understand how it works
				by createing propeties and methods



		Inheritance - Reuse the code as much as possible

		Polymorphism - Same signature, diffent behaviour
				      method
