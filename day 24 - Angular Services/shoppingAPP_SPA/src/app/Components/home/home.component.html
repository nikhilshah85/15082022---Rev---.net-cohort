A home page is generally the primary web page which a visitor navigating to a website from a search engine will see, and it may also serve as a landing page to attract visitors.[3][4] In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages.

Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website;[5] for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.[6][7] According to Homepage Usability, the homepage is the "most important page on any website" and receives the most views of any page.[8] A poorly designed home page can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site.[7] One important use of home pages is communicating the identity and value of a company.[9]

Elements
A homepage is oftentimes designed to catch attention, and as such, important elements are positioned at the top in a strict hierarchy of importance.[10] Curating which content to display on a homepage, as to not overwhelm visitors, is important to a well-designed page.[11]

Hero image
One of the commonly found aspects of a homepage is a hero image, a large eye-catching banner image often containing a photograph or drawing depicting the webpage owner's values, services, etc. as a message.[12][13] Hero images are immediately visible above the fold, without scrolling the page down.[14] A hero image may have several complementary elements as an overlay, such as the website's logo, a call to action, and a brief description.


Carousel
A descendant of the hero image is a carousel, also known as a slider. It is a slideshow-like element of the homepage with multiple images rotating every few seconds.[15] Carousels are frequently accompanied by dots and buttons in order to select different images.[16] Carousels are generally made using JavaScript but can also be made through CSS animations.[17][18] In 2013, carousels were a popular element of a homepage, with 52% of top e-commerce websites using the design feature. However, in 2016 only 32% of websites used one.[19]
