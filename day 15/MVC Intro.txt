				Design pattern for web developer - MVC 


			A web page will be divided into 3 parts - they will carry 1 responsibility



			Model (.cs file - class file) with properties, methods, constructors, variables etc.....
				Data - All the operations related to data will happen here
				CRUD operations - insert,update, delete, filter, sort, grouping, validation, formatting, calcultion
					ADO.Net
					EF 
					Excel file
					XML file
					In memory collections

			View (.cshtml file)- View file - UI 
				HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, bootstrap, images, videos, logos etc.. goes here


			Controller (.cs file) - class file - 
				collect data from model ----> pass it to view
				or
				collect data from view ----> pass it to model
			
				security
				encryptions
