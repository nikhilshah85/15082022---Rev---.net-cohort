When you develop an application which speaks and understands Common Standard language - you are in SOA world

--------------
Web Services used XML and great applications were created 
However, XML is bit heavy and slow in today world, we need something light and fast

Web Service had its own draw back, (every technology has it)
----------------------------------------

and thus a better technology for the world
and thus we have REST API Services (RESTFUL services) 
	This are based on JSON format against XML 

	This are services that run on HTTP Protocol and follows all the HTTP Standards

		Major purpose is to exchange the data 
		and we perform CRUD Operations using the service


 		C  - HttpPost
		R  - HttpGet
		U  - HttpPut
		D  - HttpDelete

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	here REST api is not an UI - it is the data part - u will see all the data on browser in JSON format
